      Adding up numbers is very easy, unless you add a twist. If two numbers are the same, sum their sums! <br>
      <h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program will be given two numbers. If they are not equal, return their sum. If they are equal, return double their sum. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Input </h1><p id="ptext">
       The first line of your programâ€™s input, received from the file named above, will contain a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case will include a single line consisting of two non-negative integers separated by spaces. <br>
       </p><p id="code"><br>5<br>
