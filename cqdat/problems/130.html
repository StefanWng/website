    <body>    <h1 id="statement">Problem 130: Basketball Score</h1>
      <p id="sub">    <em>This practice problem was made by CodeRams Co-President Xavier Plourde<br>This problem has a difficulty of 5</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>
       <br>Your favorite basketball team is playing in an important game, and you would like to determine if your team won or lost, and how close the game was.
       <br>In this problem, write a computer program to find the result of a basketball game given the two teams' scores.
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the input will contain a positive integer M less than 200, representing your favorite team's score at the end of the game<br>
       <br>The second line of the input will contain a positive integer N less than 200, not equal to M, representing the opposing team's score at the end of the game<br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       67
       <br>63<br><br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Given the two teams scores, print the following
       <br>"Blowout Win" if your team won by 10 points or more
       <br>"Close Win" if your team won by less than 10 points
       <br>"Close Loss" if your team lost by less than 10 points
       <br>"Blowout Loss" if your team lost by 10 points or more
       <br>There are never any ties in basketball (because games go into overtime), so you don't have to worry about the numbers being equal.
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       Close Win<br>
       <br>
    </p></body>
