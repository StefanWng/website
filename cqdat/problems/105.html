    <h1 id="statement">Problem 105: Goofy Gorillas</h1>
      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2019 Problem 3<br>This problem has a difficulty of 5</em></p>
    </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Background </h1><p id="ptext">
     The local zoo’s most popular exhibit contains two gorillas. However, the gorillas can cause the zookeepers some issues. We need to be able to alert the zookeepers of trouble in the gorilla compound. <br>
      <h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program will be given information about whether each of the gorillas is smiling or not. We need to alert the zookeepers if both gorillas are smiling (which might mean they’re causing trouble), or if neither gorilla is smiling (which might mean they’re about to fight). If only one gorilla is smiling, everything is probably ok. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Input </h1><p id="ptext">
       The first line of your program’s input, received from the file named above, will contain a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case will include a single line containing two boolean values (“true” or “false”) separated by spaces. <br>
       2<br></p><p id="code"><br>
       true false<br>
       true true<br><br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Output </h1><p id="ptext">
       For each test case, your program must output “true” if the zookeepers should be alerted about potential trouble, or “false” if everything seems ok. <br>
     </p><p id="code"><br>false<br>true <br>
