    <h1 id="statement">Problem 106: Caught Speeding</h1>
      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2019 Problem 4<br>This problem has a difficulty of 10</em></p>
    </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Background </h1><p id="ptext">
     You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer pulls you over. He needs to determine how big your speeding ticket should be; fortunately for you, he’s decided to give you a bit of a break if it happens to be your birthday. </p>      
       <h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program should compute the ticket you are going to receive based on the speed you were travelling: <br>
       	•	If your speed is 60 or less, you don’t get a ticket. <br>
       <br>
       	•	If your speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, you get a small ticket. <br>
       <br>
       	•	If your speed is 81 or higher, you get a big ticket. <br>
       If today is your birthday, all of these numbers are increased by 5 (for example, you can drive up to 65 without getting a ticket). <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Input </h1><p id="ptext">
       The first line of your program’s input, received from the file named above, will contain a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case will consist of a single line, including two values separated by spaces: <br>
       <br>
       	•	A positive integer representing your speed <br>
       <br>
       	•	The word “true”, indicating today is your birthday, or the word “false”, indicating it <br>
       is not. <br></p><p id="code"><br>
       3<br>
       	60 false<br>
       	82 false<br>
       	83 true<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Output </h1><p id="ptext">
       For each test case, your program must print a single line, as follows: <br>
       	•	Print “no ticket” if you do not receive a ticket <br>
       <br>
       	•	Print “small ticket” if you receive a small ticket <br>
       <br>
       	•	Print “big ticket” if you receive a big ticket <br>
       </p><p id="code"><br>no ticket<br>
       	big ticket<br>
       	small ticket<br>
       <br>
    </p></body>
