      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2019 Problem 1<br>This problem has a difficulty of 10</em></p>
    </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Background </h1><p id="ptext">
     It’s common knowledge that on the internet, TYPING IN ALL<br>
     UPPERCASE LETTERS ISN’T VERY POLITE. It just looks like you’re shouting<br>
     at people, which isn’t a very good way to hold a conversation. You’ve been asked to design a browser extension that can (forcibly) calm everyone down by converting UPPERCASE SHOUTING into lowercase whispers. Try to stay calm as you solve this problem. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program will be given lines of text in which all letters are uppercase. You must convert these letters to lowercase without otherwise changing the content of the text. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Input </h1><p id="ptext">
       The first line of your program’s input, received from the file named above, will contain a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case will include a single line of text consisting of uppercase letters, numbers, spaces, and/or punctuation. <br>
       </p><p id="code"><br>2<br>
       THIS SENTENCE IS IN ALL CAPS<br>
       SHOUTING ISN’T NICE.<br><br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Output </h1><p id="ptext">
       For each test case, your program must output the provided string after replacing all uppercase letters with their lowercase equivalents. Spaces, numbers, and punctuation should not be modified. <br>
     </p><p id= "code"><br> this sentence is in all caps<br>
       shouting isn’t nice.<br>
