    <h1 id="statement">Problem 107: Brick House</h1>
      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2019 Problem 5<br>This problem has a difficulty of 30</em></p>      <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Background </h1><p id="ptext">
       We want to build a row of bricks for our brick house that is a certain number of inches long, and we have a number of small bricks and large bricks with which to do it. You need to write an application that will decide if its is possible to build this row of bricks using some or all of the given bricks. You do not need to use all of the given bricks! <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program will be given a goal length for the brick wall and the number of small and large bricks available. Small bricks are each 1 inch long. Large bricks are 5 inches long. You will need to determine if it is possible to build a row of bricks exactly as long as the goal using only the available bricks. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Input </h1><p id="ptext">
       The first line of your program’s input, received from the file named above, will contain a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case will consist of a single line, including three non-negative integers separated by spaces: <br>
       	•	The first integer represents the number of small, one-inch-long bricks <br>
       <br>
       	•	The second integer represents the number of large, five-inch-long bricks <br>
       <br>
       	•	The third integer represents the target length of the wall, X, in inches <br>
       </p><p id="code"><br>3<br>3 1 8<br>3 1 9<br>3 2 10 <br><br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Sample Output </h1><p id="ptext">
       For each test case, your program must print a single line with the word “true” if it is possible to build a wall of exactly X inches using only the bricks available. Otherwise, it should print “false”. <br>
       </p><p id="code"><br>true<br>
       	false<br>
       	true<br>
