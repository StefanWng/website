       Students stress about their grades.  Itâs only natural, because grades are important!  However, many universities offer the option to take certain classes as pass/fail.  Generally speaking, if you get a grade of 70 or above, you pass.  Otherwise, you fail.<br>

       Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game typically played head to head by two players.  The players in unison say "rock, paper, scissors" and simultaneously form one of those three shapes with their hand.  The winner is determined by comparing hands where ROCK beats SCISSORS, SCISSORS beats PAPER, and PAPER beats ROCK.<br>
       <br>
       For this problem, you are going to be determining the winner of a series of ROCK/PAPER/SCISSORS showdowns.  Simple, right?  However, to make this more interesting, we are going to allow for a random number of players in each round (2 or more).  <br>
       <br>
       Pay close attention to the following rules when determining the winner of each round:<br>
       â¢	ROCK beats SCISSORS<br>
       â¢	SCISSORS beats PAPER<br>
       â¢	PAPER beats ROCK<br>
       â¢	If there is not a single winner, the result is "NO WINNER"<br>
       <br>
       Consider these examples:<br>
       â¢	In a 4 player game with hands of ROCK, SCISSORS, ROCK, ROCK the result is "NO WINNER" because the 3 people with ROCK each beat SCISSORS, but tie with each other.<br>
       â¢	In a 4 player game with hands of ROCK, PAPER, ROCK, ROCK the winner is "PAPER" because the single player with PAPER beats all other players with ROCK.<br>

       Can you believe that there are some math problems that still remain unsolved today?  The Collatz Conjecture is one such problem.<br>
       <br>
       To create a Collatz Sequence, start with any positive integer n.  Each term in the sequence is derived from the previous term using the following rules: if the previous term is even, then the next term is one half the previous term.  Otherwise, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.  The Collatz Conjecture states that no matter what value you pick for n, the series will eventually reach the number 1.<br>
       <br>
       For example, if we start with the number 12, it is even, so the next term is 6.  That is also even, so the next term is 3.  Three is odd, so the term after that would be 10 and so on.  The full sequence is:<br>
       <br>
       12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1<br>
       <br>
       So starting with 12, the sequence length is 10.  Your task is to write a program that will provide the length of a Collatz Sequence starting from a given number.<br>

       Youâve been hired to work on a systems diagnostic unit for the International Space Station.  This unit will monitor four critical systems â a Battery, a Heat Exchanger, a Water Pump, and a Temperature Sensor â to determine if they are working or not.  However, space is at a premium on the ISS, and so you will only have room for two LED lights for the astronauts to see!<br>
       <br>
       Your team has come up with a design that will allow the astronauts to determine which systems, if any, are broken based on the colors of the two LED lights.  Each system youâre monitoring is given a numerical value based on how critical it is to the operation and safety of the station:<br>
       <br>
       â¢	Battery: 8<br>
       â¢	Heat Exchanger: 4<br>
       â¢	Water Pump: 2<br>
       â¢	Temperature Sensor: 1<br>
       <br>
       Whenever the unit runs, it will add the values of any broken systems together and light up the LEDs to indicate the resulting number.  Each LED has four states, each representing a number â off (0), red (1), green (2), and blue (3).  The astronauts will multiply the left LEDâs value by four, then add it to the right LEDâs value, in order to determine the correct error code.  For example, if the left LED is red and the right LED is green, the astronauts would calculate the error code as (1 * 4) + 2 = 6.<br>

       Your task is to write the logic that controls the LEDs.<br>

       "Houston, weâve had a problemâ¦"<br>
       <br>
       Those are words that nobody at NASA Mission Control ever wants to hear, but they were famously said on April 13th, 1970, during the Apollo 13 Mission.  Just moments before, an electrical fault had caused the explosion of one of the oxygen tanks on the spacecraft carrying three astronauts to the Moon.  The loss of oxygen was causing the Command Module to rapidly lose power.  The only hope for survival for the three astronauts was to climb into the undamaged but much smaller Lunar Module and use it as a lifeboat to return to Earth.<br>
       <br>
       Unfortunately, the Apollo 13 crew wasnât headed towards Earth; theyâd already changed course to head towards the Moon.  To make matters worse, the debris from the explosion had rendered their normal navigation systems useless.  The Apollo crew had to work quickly with mission control to not only determine where they were in space, but get back onto a course towards Earth, and arrive before they ran out of food, water, air, or simply froze to death.  Even the slightest error could have sent them hurtling off into space, never to be seen again.  Within a few hours, however, they were able to develop new calculations that saw the crew of Apollo 13 safely land in the Pacific Ocean a few days later. <br>
       <br>
       One of the calculations the crew had to make was intended to determine the gimbal angles between the Command and Lunar Modules.  While we donât know the exact equations they used, we can simplify the problem somewhat since there arenât any lives on the line this time.  If we assume that the Lunar Module and the Command Module are docked head-to-head, their gimbals should be positioned exactly opposite one another â offset by exactly 180Â° in all directions.<br>
       <br>
       For this problem, you will need to calculate the position of the Lunar Moduleâs gimbals on the x, y, and z axes given the position of the Command Moduleâs gimbals and using the assumption described above.<br>

       Coprime integers are used as values in some cryptographic algorithms such as RSA.  Two integers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.  There are many ways to calculate the GCD of two numbers.  The Greek mathematician Euclid developed an algorithm, known today as the Euclidean algorithm or Euclidâs algorithm, to calculate the GCD of two integers.  There are many ways to implement this algorithm, and one way is using successive subtraction like this:<br>
       <br>
       When you have a subtraction problem in the form A â B = C, the letter A is called the minuend, the letter B is called the subtrahend, and the letter C is called the difference.  The following is a summary of each iteration of the algorithm:<br>
       <br>
       1.	Always put the bigger number as the minuend and the smaller number as the subtrahend.  If they are equal, then their value is the GCD.  If they are both 1, the numbers are coprime.<br>
       2.	Subtract to obtain the difference between the two.<br>
       3.	Use the subtrahend and the difference as the two numbers in the next iteration.<br>
       <br>
       The following example shows how to get the GCD of 10 and 17:<br>
       <br>
       17 â 10 = 7<br>
       10 â 7 = 3<br>

       Chess is a well-known and well-studied game.  Thousands of computer programs have been written about chess.  Some play the game interactively, while others analyze and predict strategies.  One thing is certain: if you donât know how the chess pieces move, your program will not be any good.<br>

       For this problem, we are going to take a look at a chess piece called the bishop.  The bishop can move any number of squares, but it has to move diagonally in a straight line.  Also, what fun is a standard chess board?  We are going to be using boards of random size.  One good thing though: your bishop will be the only piece on the board.<br>

       In computer graphics, images on your screen are made up of small dots called pixels.  Each of these pixels gets its color as a combination of primary colors such as Red + Green + Blue (RGB) or Cyan + Magenta + Yellow + Black (CMYK).<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <img src = "pics/011_A.png" class="center">
       <br>
       One common post-processing effect, used throughout the entire video industry from movies to weather, YouTube videos, live streams and more, is the application of a Chroma Key.  Commonly called color keying or green screen effects, this process allows the video producer to replace part of a live video feed with an image from another video source using a colored background as a mask.<br>
       <br>
       <img src = "pics/011_B.png">
       <br>
       The image on the left has a green background, and the terrain is brown.  The terrain replaces the green.<br>
       <br>
       Youâve been tasked with writing software to implement chroma keying.  Your application will be given the color of the chroma key (all colors are provided in RGB with values ranging from 0 to 255 [inclusive]) and a tolerance level for how "close" a color needs to be to the chroma key to be replaced.  Your application will be responsible for either returning the pixel color of the foreground or the pixel color of the background depending upon the chroma key and tolerance values.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       When determining whether the color is "close" enough to the chroma key, it can be helpful to consider the RGB values in a cartesian coordinate system, much like a point (x, y, z) in 3D space.  If the distance between two points in this RGB space is less than or equal to the tolerance, than the colors are considered "close" and the color should be replaced by the background color.<br>

       A prime number is an integer whose only factors are one and itself.  There are two generally primitive methods to determine if a number is prime.  You can select an arbitrary number and test through factorization, or you can find a prime number through a number field sieve. <br>
       <br>
       A Greek mathematician by the name of Eratosthenes developed an algorithm that will find all prime numbers up to a specified limit.  This algorithm is known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.<br>
       <br>
       The algorithm works by starting with the first prime number, 2, and then iteratively generating composite numbers from the prime number.  A composite number is a number that can be written as a product of two other numbers, neither of which is itself.  These composite numbers are then "sieved out" so they no longer need to be processed, because we already know they arenât prime.<br>
       <br>
       For example, letâs say that we were working with the numbers up to and including 10.  Our original prime candidate set would be {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.  Since 2 is first in the list, it must be prime.  We can now eliminate every multiple of 2 from our prime candidates, leaving us with {3, 5, 7, 9}.  Now 3 is first in the list, so 3 is a prime number.  We now eliminate multiples of 3, leaving us with {5, 7}.  Continuing on, we find that 5 and 7 are both primes.  The final set of primes between 1 and 10 is {2, 3, 5, 7}.<br>
       <br>
       Your task is to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes, even if you canât say it!<br>

Anyway, the zipper has been holding together fabric and material since 1913.  Today, you will tackle the zipper text cipher, which holds two different messages in one.<br>

       In math, a piecewise function is defined by multiple sub-functions, with each sub function applying to different input values.  Your task today is to create a piecewise encrypter!<br>
       <br>
       You were asked to create a program to encrypt a piece of text.  You will be given a set of alphabetic letters to encode.  Each alphabetic letter will be encoded by first being translated into a number as follows:<br>
       <br>
       A=1, B=2, C=3, . . . , X=24, Y=25, Z=26<br>
       <br>
       Once each letter has been converted into a number, it must be modified according to the rules in the table below. <br>
       <br>
       If the letter falls <br>
       within this range:<br>
       Use this encoding rule:<br>
       A â E<br>
       Add 6 to its numerical value.<br>
       F â J<br>
       Square its numerical value.<br>
       K â O<br>
       Divide its numerical value by 3.  Multiply the integer remainder by 5 and add 1.<br>
       P â T<br>
       Multiply the sum of the digits of its numerical value by 8.<br>
       U- Z<br>
       Find the largest integer factor of its numerical value less than the value itself.  Multiply it by 2.<br>
       <br>
       Once you get the result of applying the numeric encoding rule, convert the numerical value back to an alphabetic letter to use in your output.  For example, 7 would be converted into G.  If the result of the rule is greater than 26, divide the number by 26 and use the remainder to determine which letter it corresponds to.  For example, 27 will be encoded as A and 28 will be encoded as B.  If the result of encoding calculation is 0, the original character will be used.<br>

       You are working on a drawing program and you have been tasked with creating a function to draw star shapes.  The program already has the capability to draw line segments between points so all you need to do is calculate the coordinates for the vertices of the star.  The number of vertices in a star is double the number of the starâs points, so a five-pointed star will have ten vertices: five on the tips of the starâs points, and five in between the points.  You can draw a circle through all the vertices on the starâs points and another smaller circle through all the vertices between the points.  The center point of both circles is the same as the center point of the star.  The angles between the starâs vertices relative to the center are the all the same and add up to 360 degrees or 2Ï radians.  You can take advantage of these facts to calculate the coordinates of the starâs vertices using the formula for the coordinates of a point on a circle:<br>

      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2018 Problem 19<br>This problem has a difficulty of 85.</em></p>\n<p id="ptext">       <br>
       During World War II, the Germans used the Enigma cipher to encrypt most of their military communications.  Thought to be unbreakable, the cipher made use of typewriter-like machines that included a complicated system of rotors to scramble the text of a message.  Which rotors were used, in which order, and in what positions they were originally set determined the key used to encrypt and decrypt an Enigma message.  This complicated system led to trillions of possible keys and foiled traditional methods of breaking the cipher.<br>
       <br>
       To use an Enigma machine, an officer would press a button on a keyboard.  This would send an electrical signal through the machine and into the rotors.  Each rotor would have an input and output connection for each letter of the alphabet, but the signals would be scrambled; a signal going into the "A" position may come out at the "E" position instead.  Each rotor was wired differently and numbered so they could be easily identified.  Once the signal made it through all three rotors, it would go through a reflector which would scramble the letters again and send the signal back through the rotors one more time.  The signal would then finally turn on a light showing which letter it had turned into.  The officer would write down this letter, then continue to the next letter.<br>
       <br>
       To ensure the cipherâs security, the rotors would rotate while the message was entered.  After each letter was pressed, the rightmost rotor would rotate one position.  When that rotor returned to its original position (after 26 letters), the middle rotor would rotate one position.  Once the right rotor completed another full rotation, the middle rotor would rotate one more position.  Once the middle rotor had completed a full rotation in this manner, the left rotor would rotate one position.<br>
       <br>
       The diagrams below show what happens when trying to encrypt the message "ABC" using a six-letter Enigma machine.  The first letter, A, becomes B after leaving the left rotor, an A after leaving the middle rotor, and then a C after leaving the right rotor.  It enters the reflector, becoming an A again, then goes back through the rotors in reverse order.  It then becomes an F, then an E, then an F again as it leaves the left rotor.  The light for F turns on, indicating that the original letter A should be encoded as an F.<br>
       <br><img src="pics/019_A.png">
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       The right-most rotor then shifts down one position. This causes B to be encoded as E.<br>
       <br><img src="pics/019_B.png">
       <br>
       <br>
       The right rotor shifts once more, and the third letter, C, gets encoded as B. The final message is "FEB."<br>
       <br><img src="pics/019_C.png">
       <br>
       <br>
       You have been tasked with creating a digital version of the Enigma cipher.  Rather than encoding letters of the alphabet, it will encode the digits 0 through 9.  Four rotors and a reflector are pictured below.  However, only three of these rotors (and the reflector) will be used in each problem.  The inputs provided will indicate which rotors are to be used in which positions.  The layout of the rotors and reflector is shown below.  You have three of each rotor, so rotors can be used more than once to form a sequence of three rotors.  The reflector is always in the fourth position.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/019_D.png"><br><br>
       Each rotor above is shown in starting position 0; however, each key will require that the rotors start in a different position.  A rotor in starting position 1 should begin rotated down one position as shown in the examples above; a rotor at starting position 2 should begin rotated down two positions, and so on.  The reflector does not rotate and will remain in the position as pictured above.<br>

       In baseball statistics, the slugging percentage (SLG) is a popular measure of the power of a hitter.  You will be given a list of players and their at-bats for a single game.  You will need to compute each playerâs slugging percentage.  For this exercise, no player will be hit by a pitch.<br>
       <br>
       The slugging percentage is found by counting all the singles, doubles, triples, and home runs in a given game and applying a set weight to each achievement (home runs are worth more than singles), then dividing that number by the total number of at-bats in that game as shown here:<br>

       How long does it take to get from Earth to Mars?  The answer is âit dependsâ.  On what, you ask?  Well, to keep things simple, weâll consider the simplest distance formula:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/027_A.png">
       <br>
       <br>
       Which can be re-written as:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/027_B.png">
       <br>
       <br>
       In other words, the time it takes to get somewhere depends on how far we need to go and how fast we travel getting there.  So how far away is Mars anyway?  And how fast can we travel?<br>
       <br>
       Mars is the fourth planet from the sun, and the second closest to Earth (Venus is the closest).  But the distance between the two planets is constantly changing as they travel around the sun.  In theory, the closest that Earth and Mars would approach each other would be when Mars is at its closest point to the sun (perihelion) and Earth is at its farthest (aphelion).  This would put the planets only 33.9 million miles apart.  However, this has never happened in recorded history.  The closest approach of the two planets occurred in 2003, when they were only 34.8 million miles apart.  The two planets are farthest apart when they are both at their farthest from the sun, on opposite sides of the star.  At this point, they can be 250 million miles apart.<br>
       <br>
       The fastest spacecraft launched from Earth was NASA's New Horizons mission, which is en route to Pluto.   In January 2006, the probe left Earth at 36,000 miles per hour.<br>

       Cryptography is the art of changing information in such a way that the average person will not be able to understand it, but whoever is meant to receive the information can reverse the changes and make it understandable.  Ciphers and codes have been used for millennia to hide secrets by both private individuals and powerful governments, and many major historical events have hinged on how effective those ciphers were at hiding information.<br>
       <br>
       A VigenÃ¨re cipher (named after a famous French cryptographer) uses a keyword to determine how to replace letters in the original message (the âplaintextâ) to create the encrypted message (the âciphertextâ).  To use the VigenÃ¨re cipher, the first letter of the keyword is used to encrypt the first letter of the message.  The keyword letter is the start of a âcipherâ alphabet, the same as the normal English alphabet, but shifted over to account for the new starting letter.  The plaintext letter is then replaced with the corresponding letter in the cipher alphabet.  The second letter of the keyword is then used to encode the second letter of the plaintext, and so on; when you run out of letters in the keyword, you start with the first keyword letter again.  If you encounter a space, just transfer it to the encoded message â only letters need to be encoded.<br>
       <br>
       Letâs use âCODEâ as an example keyword, and âLOCKHEEDâ as a sample plaintext message.  First we need to build cipher alphabets for each letter in our keyword:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/028_A.png">
       <br>
       Now that we have our cipher alphabets, we can start to encrypt our message.  The first letter in the message is L.  L is the 12th letter of the alphabet, so we need to replace it with the 12th letter in our first cipher alphabet, N.  The next letter is O (15th), and uses our second cipher alphabet, to be replaced with C.  We then encrypt C using the third alphabet (getting F), and K with the fourth alphabet (getting O).  Our keyword was only four letters long, so for the fifth letter in our message, we go back to the first cipher alphabet, and replace H with J.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       The final product of the encryption is: <br>

       Personal debt is a huge political issue that affects many people, partly because they donât understand how credit cards work.  Fortunately for you, a large credit card company has hired your team to develop an algorithm to compute the monthly interest charged to their customers for balances owed on their credit cards.  The credit card company computes the interest owed by its customers using the following formula:<br>
       <br>

       Virtual Reality (VR) has exploded into the consumer market in recent years due to advances in technology and falling costs.  Originally focused on gaming experiences, these VR headsets have rapidly expanded into many different industries where they are used throughout design, engineering and manufacturing activities.  Your team is in charge of developing a Virtual Reality tool for engineers creating satellites and spacecraft.<br>
       <br>
       One of the biggest challenges in modern VR applications is maintaining high enough performance to avoid reprojection.  Reprojection is an algorithm for maintaining a responsive VR experience when performance is low, but causes a number of undesired artifacts such as judder (which can cause motion sickness).  Due to the amount of data your VR application will be displaying, youâve decided to implement an adaptive quality algorithm to minimize reprojection.<br>
       <br>
       Typically, a VR application needs to generate 90 frames (images) per second to maintain a smooth experience.  This gives the system approximately 11.1 milliseconds maximum to process each frame.  You will be given the time (in milliseconds) that the system took to render each of the previous 3 frames, and the current quality level.  Your program should print the quality level to be used by the VR application for the next frame.<br>
       <br>
       Adaptive Quality Algorithm:<br>
       <br>
       Your program will need to decide what to do based on the three previous frame processing times.  You will have the following four data points:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/032_A.png">
       <br>
       Since your VR program would like to have at least 90 frames per second, the target time per frame is:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/032_B.png">
       <br><br>
       Your algorithm will also take into account the following threshold values:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/032_C.png">
       <br><br>
       Your program should implement the following quality algorithm:<br>
       1.	If the last frame was critical (greater than the high threshold), reduce the quality level by 2.<br>
       2.	Otherwise, if the last frame was greater than the extrapolate threshold, calculate the linear extrapolation values for the two lines going through frame 2 (the first is frame 0 to frame 2, the second is frame 1 to frame 2).  The formula given below may be helpful to you.  If the maximum of those two values is greater than the high threshold, reduce the quality level by 2.<br>
       3.	Otherwise, if all three of the previous frames have values less than the low threshold, increase the quality level by 1.<br>
       4.	Otherwise, keep the quality level the same.<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/032_D.png">
       <br>
       <br>
       Consider the first example input below.  If we consider the first data point to be time 0, the second to be time 1, and the third to be time 2, then we can extrapolate the value for time 3 two different ways:<br>
       â¢	The first way, we use times 0 and 2 to predict that the value for time 3 would be 10.25.<br>
       â¢	The second way, we use times 1 and 2 to predict that the value for time 3 would be 10.3.<br>
       â¢	For our calculations, we use the larger value, which is 10.3.  The graph below illustrates this process:<br>

       Tic Tac Toe is a classic game of logic where the placement of Xâs and Oâs determines your ultimate fate!  Okay, so maybe it isnât that dramatic but it can be pretty frustrating to lose.  The good news is that it is possible to calculate the best next move possible.<br>
       <br>
       Adversarial search is an area of artificial intelligence where the computer (AI) is planning ahead in a world where other agents (players, usually human) are planning against it.  This is a common problem found in game theory.  Simple games such as tic-tac-toe and checkers are known as zero-sum games of perfect information.  Zero-sum games are games in which one playerâs gain is exactly balanced by an equal loss to the other player.  The most common artificial intelligence algorithm implemented for these types of games is called minimax.  Minimax is an algorithm designed to look at the entire game-space and to minimize the possible losses in a worst case scenario.  Because games, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, are zero-sum games, minimizing the loss condition will lead to an AI victory over the player (or in the worst case, a draw).<br>
       <br>
       Minimax is evaluated using a tree of all possible board states from the current state of the game to all ending states.  For example, at the start of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, there are 9 child states (for one each move the AI can make).  Under each of those states are 8 more states representing the moves the opponent can make.  The leaf nodes of the tree can be evaluated based upon whether the player won the game, had a draw game, or lost the game.  These utility values are then calculated back up through the tree, minimizing values on the opponents turn (this assumes the opponent always plays the best possible move) and maximizing values on the AIâs turn.  Then, if the AI always picks the highest value move, the AI is playing perfectly for the given state of the game board.<br>
       <br>
       The logic for calculating the minimax score for a particular state of tic-tac-toe is as follows:<br>
       â¢	If the AI won the game: +1<br>
       â¢	If the AI lost the game: -1<br>
       â¢	If the game was a draw: 0<br>
       â¢	If itâs the AIâs turn and the game isnât over: choose the maximum value all of child nodes<br>
       â¢	If itâs the opponentâs turn and the game isnât over: choose the minimum value of all child nodes<br>
       <br>
       Jon has been losing a lot of tic-tac-toe games recently.  Heâs asked you to make him a program where he can input the current state of the board and have the artificial intelligence tell him the best move to he should make for his current situation.  Assume Jon is always Xâs and the opponent is always Oâs.  X plays first.<br>

       <img src="pics/036_A.png" class="center">
       <br>
       <br>
       To pick the best move for Jon use the following logic:<br>
       â¢	If thereâs a winning move, pick it<br>
       â¢	Otherwise, pick the highest scoring move based upon the minimax algorithm<br>
       â¢	If two moves have the same score or are otherwise equivalent, such as two winning moves, use the following ranking of the Tic-Tac-Toe spaces to determine which one should be used:<br>

       Launching rockets is a tricky business.  Each launch vehicle is required to be fueled at a launch site.  At our launch site, there are N identical large cylindrical tanks for storing fuel.  The tanks are arranged in a circle on level ground.  Each tank is connected to its two neighbors by means of a pipe situated at its base (tank 2 is connected to tanks 1 and 3, and so on).  There is a valve between each adjacent pair of tanks.  All valves are initially closed.  All the outlets and the pipes are at the same level and can hold a negligible amount of fuel.<br>
       <br>
       The volume in any tank is determined by measuring the height of the surface of the fuel above the level of the top of the outlets.  If all valves (or all valves but one) are opened so that fuel can flow between the tanks, then the levels will eventually equalize.<br>
       <br>
       Conversely, if all tanks are initially at the same level, no valves need be opened to equalize the levels.  Thus it may be necessary to only open some of the valves to achieve this equalization result.<br>
       <br>
       For example, consider the situation where we have N = 4 tanks, and the fuel level in these tanks starts at 4, 4, 3, and 3.  The fuel levels will equalize if we open the valves between tanks #2 and #3 and between #4 and #1, as suggested by the following diagram:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="pics/037_A.png">
       <br>
       <br>
       Thus for this setup we need to open only two valves to achieve fuel equalization.  Your job is to write a program that will calculate the minimum number of valves that must be opened at a given launch site to equalize their fuel levels.<br>

       Being named valedictorian of the graduating class is a great honor.   While different schools may use slightly different methods of determining the valedictorian, grade point average (GPA) is often the primary measure.  <br>
       <br>
       You have been entrusted to identify the valedictorian of each high school graduating class, based on GPA, using the following guidelines:<br>
       <br>
       1.	The valedictorian shall be the student with the highest GPA.<br>
       2.	Possible grades and their grade values are:<br>
       â¢	A = 4 points<br>
       â¢	B = 3 points<br>
       â¢	C = 2 points<br>
       â¢	D = 1 point<br>
       3.	Credit hours for a class can range from 1 to 4 hours.<br>
       4.	Grade points for a single course = the grade value * credit hours.<br>
       5.	GPA = total grade points divided by total credit hours.<br>
       6.	If 2 or more students have identical GPAs, the student with the highest total credit hours is the winner.  There will not be a case where two or more students have identical highest GPAs as well as the same number of credit hours.<br>

       In todayâs world of GPS, mobile networks, and the multitude of mapping tools that work on everything from your car to your phone, you are never more than a tap or click away from seeing a map of where you are anywhere on the globe.  To make this possible, mapping tools break the world up into small images called tiles. <br>
       <br>
       These tiles represent the satellite and map imagery, and are organized by what part of the world they show and at what zoom level they show it.  To support all the different app developers, most satellite and map imagery suppliers have tile servers that provide access to the map tiles from any standard HTTP/S (web) connection.  The map tiles themselves are always 256 x 256 images and the size of the world they cover depends upon the zoom level they represent.<br>
       <br>
       â¢	At a zoom level of 0, one tile image represents the entire world.<br>
       â¢	At a zoom level of 1, the world is represented by a 2x2 grid of tile images (for a total of 4 tiles).<br>
       â¢	At a zoom level of 2, the world is represented by a 4x4 grid of tile images (for a total of 16 tiles).<br>
       â¢	At a zoom level of N, the world is represented by x grid of tile images (for a total of  tiles).<br>
       <br>
       Accessing a particular tile from a satellite or map imagery provider is usually as easy as following a standard URL format.  The most common format uses a directory structure where the first folder is the zoom level, followed by the x coordinate with the y coordinate being the name of the tile image.<br>
       <br>
       The following example is a URL to download a tile from OpenStreetMap (an open data, community driven, map data provider).  In the example below, z is the zoom level of the map tile and x, y are the Web Mercator projection of the Longitude and Latitude adjusted for the specified zoom level.<br>
       <br>
       http://tile.openstreetmap.org/z/x/y.png<br>
       <br>
       Mercator projection is a method of projecting the world onto flat surface (such as a map).  Originally, it was the standard projection used for nautical navigation charts and a variant of it, called Web Mercator, continues to see use today in most mapping tools.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       The following formulas convert Longitude and Latitude to the tile server x, y values:<br>

       <img src="pics/046_A.png" class="center">
       <br>

       Pilots have a lot to think about!  In order to make their job a bit easier, you have been tasked to develop a âGround Collision Avoidance Systemâ (GCAS) for the brand new F-X program.  This system is responsible for providing an audible warning to the pilot if they are in danger of colliding with the ground.  To do this, the GCAS maintains digital maps of terrain data and predicts the aircraftâs flight path.<br>
       <br>
       As soon as the aircraft takes off, the GCAS becomes active.  Your program will be responsible for reading sensor data containing the current altitude of the aircraft as well as the ground elevation along the aircraftâs current path.  You will use this data to decide how the GCAS will interact with the pilot.<br>
       <br>
       The GCAS is a predictive tool â meaning it canât know what the pilot intends to do in the next time unit.  Therefore, its best guess is to calculate the change in altitude that the aircraft experienced in the current time unit and assume that the same change will happen in the next time unit.<br>
       <br>
       The GCAS should work like this:<br>
       â¢	If the system thinks that the aircraft will crash in the next time unit, it should print âPULL UP!â<br>
       â¢	If the system does not anticipate a crash but the aircraft is 500 ft. or less above the current ground elevation, it should print âLow Altitude!â<br>
       â¢	If the system does not anticipate a crash and the aircraft has more than 500 ft. of altitude above the current ground elevation, it should print âokâ.<br>

       Security has become one of the most important topics in the computing industry.  There is no shortage of people trying to steal data or gain access to things they shouldnât.  At the heart of protecting our systems is encryption.  Encryption is the process of encoding data into a form that only the people who are allowed to view the data are able to decode and read it.<br>
       <br>
       One method of encryption involves using a substitution cipher.  A substitution cipher is where each letter in a message is substituted for another letter.  For example, âhelloâ might be encrypted into âifmmpâ by substituting i=h, e=f, l=m, and o=p.<br>
       <br>
       You have been hired to encrypt and decrypt messages according to the cipher key (the mapping for the alphabet into the new encoding).  You must be able to both encrypt and decrypt messages, where encrypt means to map from the standard English alphabet to the cipher key and decrypt means to map from the cipher key to the standard English alphabet.  You must also be adaptable to being given a different cipher key each time. <br>
       <br>
       â¢	Spaces should not be encrypted or decrypted, merely transferred to the encrypted or decrypted message directly.<br>
       â¢	The letters map to the cipher regardless of capitalization (i.e. âaâ and âAâ will both map to the same letter, but the capitalization will be different).  Capitalization should be preserved from input to output messages.<br>

       You are on vacation in orbit around the planet Neptune.  You are having so much fun that you are willing to let your inhibitions fly away with the solar wind and take a selfie to send to your relatives on Earth.  Your space phone can send the image to Earth; however, since Neptune and Earth are so far away from each other, radiation interference can corrupt the data.  Furthermore, in order to not tie up the space phone network, data must be sent in small chunks.  Luckily for you, technology has advanced to the point that messages are received in the order they are sent.  Because of the potential for interference, the space phone receiver on Earth may need to ask your space phone for parts of the image multiple times depending on interference and data corruption.  A space phone company, Luca Industries, uses the Patriot Protocol to ensure message integrity.<br>
       <br>
       Each Message (M) from your phone has Information (I) and a Remainder (R). Together they form what is known as the Luca Industries Data Chunk.<br>
       <br>
       The Luca Industries Data Chunk:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/049_A.png">
       <br>
       The protocol provides a way for the message to the receiver to ensure with a high degree of certainty that there was no data corruption.  This is done by adding extra digits (the remainder) to the end of the message.<br>
       <br>
       The sender and receiver of any transmission using the Luca Industries Patriot Protocol use a pre-defined polynomial as part of the protocol.  We call this the Patriot Protocol Polynomial, or P3 for short.  For this problem, your P3 is:<br>
       <br>
       1011<br>
       <br>
       When sending a message from your space phone, this polynomial is used to determine the remainder to append to the information for each message.  This is done using binary long division of the message by the polynomial.  The length of the remainder is the length of the polynomial minus one.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       Encoding<br>
       The following example shows how we would encrypt the data 11101110 using the Patriot Protocol:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/049_B.png"
       <br>
       The remainder 001 is then appended to the message yielding the Luca Industries Data Chunk 11101110001<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       Decoding<br>
       <br>
       The receiving side performs the same binary long division.  If the data integrity was maintained, there should be no remainder after division.  Otherwise, we can assume there was data corruption during transmission.<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/049_C.png">
       <br>
       Notice that the P3 always slides to a position where its leftmost bit is beneath the leftmost bit in the data that contains a 1.  Also notice that the division is done using the exclusive or function on the bits of the data and the P3 (meaning a 1 results if either the P3 or the data contains a 1, but not if they both do).<br>

       The commutative property of addition means that if you are adding numbers together, it doesnât matter what order you add them in.  1 + 2 = 3, and 2 + 1 = 3.  You will use this special property of addition to show just how many different ways you can sum up numbers.  Given a list of numbers, you must write a program that finds all possible multiset permutations of these numbers that add up to a specified sum.<br>
       <br>
       What is a multiset permutation?  Iâm glad you asked.  It is a permutation of a set of objects (in this case digits) where objects of the same type are freely interchangeable.  In the example input below, the second test case has two â1â digits.  However, the equation 1+1+2 only appears once in the output.  That is because switching the 1s around does not form a new equation, even though they are different instances of the number 1.<br>

       This problem isnât about Thanksgiving, itâs about bowling!  If youâve ever gone bowling, then you know that the scoring can be complicated.  Thatâs why we want you to write a program to do it.  Just in case you donât know, here is how a bowling game works:<br>
       <br>
       Frames<br>
       <br>
       In bowling, each time the pins are set up for you to knock them down is called a frame.  There are ten frames in a bowling game.  You get two chances to knock down all ten pins.  After your second chance, the remaining pins are discarded, and a fresh set of pins is set up to start the next frame.  The only exception to this is if you get a strike or a spare in the 10th frame.  If that happens, the 10th frame will have three chances due to the scoring for strikes and spares (see below).<br>
       <br>
       The Scorecard<br>
       <br>
       When you roll your bowling ball towards the pins, one of 4 things will happen:<br>
       â¢	If you hit no pins, the scoreboard will show a dash (-).  You wonât see any zeroes on a bowling scorecard.<br>
       â¢	If you knock down all the pins on your first attempt, it is called a strike.  A strike is denoted by a capital x (X).<br>
       â¢	If you knock down all the remaining pins on your second attempt, it is called a spare.  A spare is denoted by a forward slash (/).<br>
       â¢	If you knock down some pins but some still remain, you will see the number of pins you knocked down with that ball.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       Scoring<br>
       <br>
       In general, every pin that you knock down gives you one point.  There are two exceptions:<br>
       â¢	When you get a spare, you are awarded points for the pins you knocked down to get the spare plus the number of pins you knock down with your next ball.<br>
       o	For example, if in the first frame of the game you knocked down 4 pins and then 6 pins to get a spare, and in the second frame you knocked down 3 pins with your first ball, the total score for the first frame would be 13 points (4 + 6 + 3).<br>
       â¢	When you get a strike, you are awarded points for the pins you knocked down to get the strike (always 10) plus the number of pins you knock down with your next two balls.<br>
       o	For example, if in the first frame of the game you knock down all 10 pins with your first ball to get a strike, and in the second frame you knock down 4 pins and then 3 pins, the total score for the first frame would be 17 points (10 + 4 + 3).<br>
       o	Another example: if in the first three frames you get a strike (three strikes in a row is called a turkey, by the way), then the total score in the first frame would be 30 (10 + 10 + 10).  For this reason, the maximum bowling score is 300 (30 points for each of the 10 frames).<br>
       <br>
       The 10th Frame<br>
       <br>
       The 10th frame is special because it is the last frame.  Here is how the 10th frame works:<br>
       â¢	If you do not get a strike or a spare in the 10th frame, then it is scored just like any other frame.<br>
       â¢	If you get a spare, you are awarded one more ball to bowl (so you can add those points to the spare).  If you get a strike, no more attempts are awarded.  The 10 pins you knocked down with your extra ball are added to the spare, and the game is over.<br>
       â¢	If you get a strike, you are awarded two more balls to bowl (so you can add those points to the strike).  If you get a strike or a spare with your two extra balls, no more attempts are awarded.  The pins you knocked down with your extra balls (20 max) are added to the strike, and the game is over.<br>
       <br>
       Whew!  Are you ready?  Let's go bowling!<br>

       The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle.  It was invented in 1883 by French mathematician Edouard Lucas.  It consists of three pegs labeled A, B, and C and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any peg.  The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on peg A, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.<br>
       <br>
       The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack from peg A to peg C using peg B to help, obeying the following simple rules:<br>
       1.	Only one disk can be moved at a time.<br>
       2.	Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack; i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.<br>
       3.	No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.<br>
       <br>
       With two disks, the puzzle can be solved in three moves, with three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves.  The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n - 1, where n is the number of disks.<br>
       <br>

       An exciting new planet in another planetary system has been discovered by the Kepler telescope.  Scientists want to launch a satellite to this new planet and have asked you to write a program to plot a course that will require the least amount of time to get there.  They believe the satellite can escape our solar system leaving with the speed of over about 17Km/s and thus taking around 20,000 years to travel a light year.  The satellite has a solar chargeable battery that can hold a maximum 20 units of energy to power its instruments and thrusters.  The satellite consumes 1 unit of energy every light year it travels.  The idea is to hop from star to star consuming energy until the destination is reached without draining the entire battery.<br>
       <br>
       Here are the guidelines for your journey:<br>
       â¢	In order to simplify your distance calculations, you break space up into a series of cubes, each with a volume of one cubic lightyear.  This means that it will take one unit of energy to travel from the center of one cube to the center of any adjacent cube.<br>
       â¢	Diagonal movements are not allowed.  You have carefully managed the orientation of the space cubes such that movements along the x, y, and z axes will avoid collisions with stars and black holes.<br>
       â¢	You start your journey in the origin cube (0, 0, 0).  Your destination is in cube (N-1, N-1, N-1).<br>
       â¢	The battery can only hold a maximum of 20 units of energy, and you start with a full battery.<br>
       â¢	The battery can be briefly charged by flying through a cube that contains a sun.  The amount of energy units gained is based on the star type in the table below.  Remember, 20 units is a fully charged battery.  Any excess solar energy is lost.<br>

       <img src="pics/053_A.png">
       <br>
       <br>
       â¢	If you approach a cube without a sun with the battery drained, then the mission fails.  For example, if you have 1 energy unit left and then move to the cube below you and no star is there, then the mission fails; however, if you move above you with a G-type star, then youâll end up with 5 units of energy in that cube with the star.<br>
       â¢	You canât return to a star you already flew by as this will affect your momentum.<br>

       A honeycomb is an efficient way to visualize a set of interconnected spaces.  In a honeycomb, each space is connected to at least two other spaces and at most six other spaces.  Four of these possible connections are diagonal: up left, up right, down left, and down right.  The other two are simply left and right.<br>

       In this problem, you are a honey bee.  You are currently located at the top of the honeycomb triangle.  You are supposed to leave soon to go gather pollen, but you left your pollen brush in the bottom right corner of the triangle.

Since the door to the bee hive is just above the top of the honeycomb, you need to find the fastest route to go from the top of the honeycomb to the bottom right, then to the bottom left, and back to the top again.<br>

       Not all years are created equal.  Every now and then (approximately every four years), we get an extra day to enjoy because of a leap year.  Leap years occur because we need to keep the calendar year in sync with the astronomical year, so we insert an extra day (February 29th) to correct the difference between the calendars.<br>
       <br>
       Most of the world uses the Gregorian calendar to keep track of the calendar year.  The Gregorian calendar was first used in the year 1582, so there were no leap years before that time.  Under this calendar system, years that are not leap years are called common years.  Here is the pseudo code for telling the difference between common years and leap years:<br>
       <br>
       â¢	If the year is prior to 1582, then it is a common year<br>
       â¢	Else if the year is not divisible by 4 then it is a common year<br>
       â¢	Else if the year is not divisible by 100 then it is a leap year<br>
       â¢	Else if the year is not divisible by 400 then it is a common year<br>

       Talking about the weather has been one of the most common small-talk subjects since the beginning of time.  âWhew, can you believe this heat wave?  Itâs been 38 degrees for days!â  Wait, what?  Anyone who lives in Texas should know better than to complain when the temperature gets above 38 degrees.  Or should they?  It all depends on the temperature scale!<br>
       <br>
       Here in the United States, we still use the Fahrenheit temperature scale, while most of the rest of the world uses the Celsius scale.  Just like talking to people who speak different languages, if we want to be able to talk about the weather with someone who uses a different scale, we need a translator.  Thatâs where you come in!<br>

       You are in charge of directing a state-of-the-art, fifth-generation fighter jet to a safe landing aboard the USS Quest Aircraft Carrier.  If the aircraft glide-slope is too steep or too shallow, you must indicate to the pilot that he or she must abort the landing and retry.  Only when the glide slopes to the targeted landing zone are within tolerances are you to indicate to the pilot that he or she may commit to the landing.<br>
       <br>
       You must calculate the glide slopes and determine if they are within tolerance for a safe landing.  If the slope of approach is between -.8 and -1.6 (inclusive), the aircraft is clear to land â otherwise it is waved off.  Because you are landing on a carrier, you must consider both the slope between the plane and the front of the landing zone as well as the slope between the plane and the end of the landing zone.  Both slopes must be within tolerance for a safe landing.<br>

       Tennis scoring is similar to other games, but it has been cleverly encoded to sound strange to non-tennis fans.  Today, you will break this code and write a program to keep track of the score of a tennis game.<br>
       <br>
       Game, Set, Match<br>
       <br>
       When two players play each other in tennis, they are playing a tennis match.  The overall objective is to win the match.  A tennis match is made up of sets, and a set is made up of games.  We will not concern ourselves with the match or set scoring today â only a single game.<br>
       <br>
       A tennis game is made up of points.  A player wins a tennis game by being the first player to win four points, but you must win by two.  There are no tie-breakers in games.<br>
       <br>
       Whatâs love got to do with it?<br>
       <br>
       So far, tennis sounds easy, right?  The clever encoding of tennis scores comes at the point level.  The following table describes the different names for tennis points:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/064_A.png">
       <br>
       Tennis scores are usually separated by a dash with the serverâs score first, and in our games player 1 will always be serving.  Some example scores are 15-30 and 40-love.<br>
       <br>
       When the score is tied, tennis does things a little differently.  Tie scores of 15-15 and 30-30 are called â15-allâ and â30-allâ respectively.  After this point, when the score is tied at 40-40 or beyond, the score is referred to as âdeuceâ.<br>
       <br>
       Once a deuce situation is encountered, the score is called out according to which player has the âadvantageâ, meaning the player that needs to win the next point to win the game.  So, after a deuce the only two possible scores would be âAdvantage Player 1â or âAdvantage Player 2â.  Depending on who wins the point after that, either the game is over or the score is tied at deuce again.<br>

       Soundex is a phonetic hashing algorithm that groups together names that sound similar yet have minor differences in spelling.  It can be useful for genealogical studies by identifying variations for a given surname.  The hashing part of the algorithm uses the following character groups:<br>
       â¢	Group 1: b, f, p, v<br>
       â¢	Group 2: c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z<br>
       â¢	Group 3: d, t<br>
       â¢	Group 4: l<br>
       â¢	Group 5: m, n<br>
       â¢	Group 6: r<br>
       â¢	Wild: h, w<br>
       â¢	Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y<br>
       <br>
       An American Soundex code for a name consists of a letter followed by a three digit number.  The code can be determined by the following steps:<br>
       1.	Find the first letter in the name that belongs to one of the numbered groups.  Starting from that letter and working left to right, if two or more letters from the same numbered group are adjacent to one another, remove all but the first letter.  Note that h and w are âwildâ meaning that they will match letters from any group 1-6.<br>
       2.	Retain the first letter of the name and remove all vowels and wild letters.<br>
       3.	Retain the first letter of the name and replace all other letters with their group number.<br>
       4.	If there are less than three numbers, add zeroes until there are three.  If there are more than three numbers, just keep the first three.  Make sure the letter at the beginning is capitalized.<br>

       When computer data disruption and corruption cannot be tolerated, such as in scientific or financial computing applications, Error-Correcting Code (ECC) memory can be used to limit the impact of electrical and magnetic interference inside of a computer.  One of the most popular ECC techniques is implemented through a hamming code.  A hamming code includes a number of extra parity bits in precise locations that allow for the detection and correction of errors.  The number of parity bits that you need to add depends on the length of the data you are trying to encode.  The general algorithm for creating a hamming code is as follows:<br>
       <br>
       1.	Number the bits from left to right starting with the number 1.<br>
       2.	Label the bit positions with their numbers converted to binary:<br>
       a.	Bits whose position numbers are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, etc.) are the parity bits.  Notice that these are the positions where there is a single 1 in the binary representation of the bit position number.  This is the key to calculating the value of the parity bits.<br>
       b.	All other bits are the data bits.<br>
       3.	Fill in the data bits with the original data.<br>
       4.	Calculate the value of the parity bits.  For this problem, we will be using even parity.<br>
       a.	Parity is calculated by adding the value of each checked bit.  If the value is even, the parity is 0; if the value is odd, the parity is 1.<br>
       b.	Parity bit 1 checks all bit positions which have the least significant bit set to 1 (1, 3, 5â¦)<br>
       c.	Parity bit 2 checks all bit positions which have the second least significant bit set to 1 (2, 3, 6â¦)<br>
       d.	Parity bit 4 checks all bit positions which have the third least significant bit set to 1 (4-7, 12-15â¦)<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       Example hamming code:<br>
       <br>
       Suppose we had an original input of 1101, and we wanted to create the hamming code for this set of bits.  We would do the following:<br>
       <br>
       1.	Calculate the number of parity bits we need.  Remember that the parity bits are in the bit positions that are a power of two.  You can notice from the table below that adding a parity bit at position M gives us an additional M-1 data bits that we can encode.  For this example, we have 4 data bits.  Parity bit 1 does not give us any data bits.  Parity bit 2 gives us one data bit, and parity bit 4 gives us three more.  Thus, we need 7 bits total: 3 for parity, and 4 for data.<br>
       2.	Calculate the values of the parity bits using the algorithm above.  The table below shows the bits considered when calculating each parity bit.<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/066_A.png">
       <br>
       For each parity bit calculation, the parity bitâs position is highlighted black, and the bits used to calculate it are highlighted grey.  Looking at parity bit 2, its position number in binary is 0010, so it only cares about positions that fit the pattern xx1x, where the x could be either a 0 or a 1.  Positions 3, 6, and 7 fit this pattern.  Two of the three of those data bits are 1, so the parity bitâs value is 0 because there are an even number of 1 values in the data for that parity bit.<br>

       Sky scrapers are the tallest man-made structures in the world; the tallest being Burj Khalifa in Dubai.  They are expertly designed to stretch high into the sky and resist wind and seismic activity.  Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to build the tallest sky scraper possible from a set of bricks.  But like any good construction project there are design requirements:<br>
       â¢	You will be given a set of rectangular bricks of varying sizes.  You can use each brick only once.<br>
       â¢	You must stack them on top of one another to build the tallest structure possible.<br>
       â¢	You can only stack a brick on top of another brick if the dimensions of the lower brickâs top are greater than or equal to the base of the brick you are stacking on top.<br>
       â¢	You can rotate the brick so that any of the sides can function as its base.<br>
       â¢	Brick surfaces must stay parallel to the x, y, and z axes, so only 90 degree rotation is possible in any direction.<br>

       This problem is an example of an NP-complete type problem.  What that means is that there is no slick algorithm that will cut your programâs running time down.  It also means that we promise to keep the judging input set small.  In our testing, even 50 blocks made us go over the 2 minute run time allotted for problem submissions.  The judging data will have a maximum of 25 blocks, and our solution will run for a maximum of 30 seconds.  The judging software will allow your program two minutes to run before timing out.

       Last month Bobby reported to the police that someone broke into his house and stole his favorite pair of jeans.  He was extremely distraught and asked the police to do whatever it takes to find the burglar.  The police looked for DNA samples from around the house.  Luckily they found only one, and they believe it belongs to the burglar.  Unfortunately, the policeâs database searching program is on the fritz so they want you to create a program to search their database of all the people in the town and find the closest DNA match.<br>
       <br>
       DNA samples are rarely perfect â parts of a sample could be missing or contaminated.  Therefore, a direct match is not usually found.  The police use the âlongest common subsequenceâ method to find the most likely suspect.  Two strings share a common subsequence if they have the same set of letters in the same order, but the letters in the subsequence do not necessarily have to be adjacent to one another.<br>
       <br>
       For example:<br>
       â¢	The string ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ has subsequences KNOT and MOW, but not PAT.<br>
       â¢	The longest common subsequence between the strings ABAFCDEF and BCFEDE is BCDE.<br>
       <br>

       Reverse Polish Notation (RPN, also called postfix notation) is a mathematical notation where the operator (+, -, *, /, etc.) follows the operands.  For example, 2 + 3 in postfix notation is 2 3 +.  This notation has the advantage that itâs easy to evaluate in a computer program and it doesnât require parenthesis to handle order of operations.<br>
       <br>
       Your task is to write a program that will convert expressions from algebraic (also called infix) notation to RPN.<br>
       <br>
       Some Notes on RPN<br>
       <br>
       â¢	Operators use the two operands to their left if youâre looking at the final RPN equation.  Once used, the result becomes available as an operand for another operation.<br>
       o	A + B â C * D --> A B + C D * -<br>
       <br>
       In this example, A and B are added together and saved for later.  C and D are multiplied together and saved for later.  The minus sign at the end acts on both saved values and subtracts the two.<br>
       â¢	Operators are used from left to right.  Note the difference between these two lines because we know multiplication has to happen before addition.  The order of the operators is switched in the second example to account for the order in which the operations must happen.<br>
       o	A * B + C --> A B * C + <br>
       o	A + B * C --> A B C * +<br>
       â¢	Exponentiation is right-associative (meaning if two exponent operations are next to each other, they happen from right to left instead of left to right):<br>
       o	2 ^ 2 ^ 3 is the same as 2 ^ (2 ^ 3), not (2 ^ 2) ^ 3<br>
       â¢	The operands should stay in the same order in your output.  For example, if you were given the expression A + B, the answers A B + and B A + are mathematically equivalent because of the commutative property of addition.  However, for the purposes of this problem, the only acceptable answer would be A B +.<br>

       Sorting is one of the most common things you are asked to do as a programmer.  In fact, higher level languages and third party libraries make it easier to do things like sort numbers without even knowing whatâs happening behind the scenes.  We say âno moreâ!  Today, you will implement the valley sort algorithm on lists of numbers.<br>
       <br>
       What?  Youâve never heard of the valley sort?  Thatâs because we made it up.  At least we think we did â we Googled it and didnât find anything similar.  The valley sort goes something like this:<br>
       <br>
       The biggest number should wind up being first in the list after sorting.<br>
       The second biggest number should wind up being last in the list after sorting.<br>
       The third biggest number should wind up being second in the list after sorting.<br>
       The fourth biggest number should wind up being second from the last in the list after sorting.<br>
       <br>
       And so on.  Check the example input and output for a couple of visual examples.  We think they will make sense.<br>

       The invention of e-reading technology on computers, cell phones, tablets, and e-readers is revolutionizing the book industry.  In years past, there were a handful of publishers capable of bringing a book to publication.  Now, almost anyone with a computer can become an independent publishing house.  As the number of publishers grow, so too will the number of books.  This is beneficial to authors and consumers, but can be problematic for standards organizations that are charged with maintaining order among industries.<br>
       <br>
       A bookâs ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is a way to uniquely identify a work while simultaneously providing information about that work.  ISBNs currently have 13 digits broken down into the following sections:<br>
       1.	A 3 digit prefix assigned by the GS1 standards organization (currently 978 or 979, but they could be anything).<br>
       2.	A registration group number that varies from 1 to 5 digits.  This number identifies the region or language of the work.<br>
       3.	A registrant element, which identifies a specific publisher.<br>
       4.	A publication element, which identifies a work published by the publisher.<br>
       5.	A single check digit (used to verify the legitimacy of the ISBN).<br>
       <br>
       The check digit is assigned in such a way that taking the sum of all 13 numbers, each multiplied by a factor alternating between 1 and 3, is a factor of 10.  For example, for ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7:<br>
       <br>
        9*1 + 7*3 + 8*1 + 0*3 + 3*1 + 0*3 + 6*1 + 4*3 + 0*1 + 6*3 + 1*1 + 5*3 + 7*1<br>
       =  9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15 +   7<br>
       = 100<br>
       <br>
       Since 100 is a factor of 10, this is a valid ISBN number.  There is no standard format for an ISBN.  ISBNs can contain dashes or other separating characters (spaces, underscores, etc.) that can make them more readable by humans, or they can just be 13 digits in a row.  Your job is to validate a list of ISBN candidate numbers.<br>

       Everything in a computer boils down to ones and zeroes â things we call bits.  More accurately, we think of a bit represented by a 1 to be considered âonâ, and that is measured by the presence of an electric charge.  We think of a bit represented by a 0 to be considered âoffâ, and that is measured by the lack of an electric charge.  Today we have computers that have billions of bits that we can put together to form useful information â information that can be readily consumed by untrained users (like text on a screen).  But what if there were only a single bit?<br>
       <br>
       Back in 1836, Samuel Morse needed a way to transmit messages using only electric current.  The problem: how to represent text using only an âonâ or an âoffâ signal at a single node.  The answer: the length of time that the bit was on or off would have to mean something.  The product: Morse code!  Here is how Morse code works:<br>
       <br>
       â¢	The building blocks of Morse code are the âdotâ and the âdashâ.  A dot is an electric signal with a length of one time unit.  A dash is an electric signal with the length of three time units.<br>
       â¢	The space between dots and dashes within a single letter has a length of one time unit.<br>
       â¢	The space between letters in the same word has a length of three time units.<br>
       â¢	The space between two words has a length of seven time units.<br>
       <br>
       Your task has two parts: first, read in some text and turn it into Morse code.  Second, read in some Morse code and decode it into text.  The last page of this problem has a translation table for you to use when coding your solution.<br>

       The file Prob07.in.txt will contain the following:<br>
       â¢	Some number of lines of text that you are to read in and change to Morse code.  Line breaks should be preserved, so your output should have the same number of lines that the input text has.  There will be only text â no numbers, and no special characters or punctuation.<br>
       â¢	A line reading END OF TRANSMISSION which will serve as the break point between the text and the Morse code that you are to interpret.<br>
       â¢	Some number of lines of Morse code that you are to read in and change to plain text.  Again, line breaks should be preserved.<br>
       â¢	A line reading END OF TRANSMISSION which will denote the end of the file<br>

       Because Morse code deals only with the presence or absence of an electrical current, you will use the following when translating between text and Morse code:<br>
       â¢	The presence of an electrical current will be represented by an equal sign (=).<br>
       â¢	The absence of an electrical current will be represented by an underscore (_).<br>
       <br>
       Your output should mimic the input file by having the following four elements:<br>

       Have you ever seen a spray paint artist?  Their art depends on layering â they spray lots of colors on top of each other and then scrape paint away to make beautiful scenes.  In this problem, you will deal with layered rectangles in a workspace grid.  Your art will involve these rectangles layered on top of each other.<br>
       <br>
       Lockheed's stealth technology has influenced the world of rectangle art by providing rectangle artists with a mysterious material that turns clear when there are even numbers of layers of that material touching each other.  So, any square in the grid that is covered by an odd number of rectangles appears covered, while squares in the grid with an even number of rectangles covering a space appear to be uncovered.<br>
       <br>
       Your task is to write a program that will compute what a workspace will look like after placing these special rectangles down.  All your inputs will be given in Cartesian format.<br>

       Since their invention over 200 years ago, trains have provided a safe and efficient method of transportation.  Passenger trains carry hundreds of travelers from station to station, requiring only track to be laid between them.  In the beginning, train stations had dedicated tracks which linked them.  This proved to be a waste of infrastructure as much track was going unused the majority of the time.  Railroad switches were designed to solve this problem.  Switches allow trains to quickly cross to an adjacent track.  In this manner, trains were no longer bound to the track they began their journey on.   Your task will be to determine, for each starting station, what the end station is given a layout of interconnected tracks.<br>

      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2014 Problem 12<br>This problem has a difficulty of 55</em></p>\n<p id="ptext">       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Introduction</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The Caesar and Syctale ciphers are very old ciphers used by the ancient Greeks to encrypt secret messages.  In this problem you will be decrypting a message that has been encoded using both methods.<br>
       <br>
       </p><h1 id="spec">The Caesar Cipher</h1><p id="ptext"><br>
       <br>
       The Caesar cipher is a form of a substitution cipher because it substitutes letters for other letters.  A Caesar cipher just shifts letters however many positions to the left or the right.  For example:<br>
       <br>
       LOCKHEED --> right shift 3 --> ORFNKHHG<br>
       <br>
       Letters are shifted as if we were using an alphabet ring.  That is, shifting Z to the right produces an A, and so forth.  So, the string âZebraâ shifted 1 position to the right would be âAfcsbâ.  Note that capitalization is retained.<br>
       <br>
       </p><h1 id="spec">The Scytale Cipher</h1><p id="ptext"><br>
       <br>
       The Scytale cipher is a form of transposition in that it rearranges letters into different positions.  In a Scytale cipher, you would wrap a very long piece of paper around a stick and write your message going across.  The message would be unreadable when unwrapped.  You had to use the same stick to decrypt the message.  This is similar to picking a two dimensional array and filling it with the message.  For example, the word âLOCKHEEDâ using a 4x3 array would produce this:<br>
       <img src="pics/081_A.png"><br>
       A capital X is used to pad the array if the message doesnât fill the array exactly.  To âunravelâ the paper, read the array from top to bottom, left to right:<br>
       <br>
       LOCKHEED --> LKEXOHDXCEXX<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       </p><h1 id="spec">Putting Them Together</h1><p id="ptext"><br>
       <br>
       For this problem, you must decrypt a message that was encrypted using the Caesar cipher followed by a Scytale.  Letâs look at the âLOCKHEEDâ example:<br>
       <br>
       LOCKHEED --> Caesar +3 --> ORFNKHHG --> Scytale 4x3 --> ONHXRKGXFHXX<br>
       <br>
       There are a couple of things that are important to note:<br>
       â¢	If the input string was too short to fill the array exactly, the encrypted Scytale string will have more characters than the original decrypted message.  Be careful when printing your output because of this.  You can assume that the original message does not end in a capital X.<br>
       â¢	You will not know the array size that was used to perform the Scytale cipher, but it is guaranteed that the number of characters in the encoded input file will fit exactly into the array used.<br>
       â¢	You will not know the shift value that was used to perform the Caesar cipher, but the original text is guaranteed to have the word âDearâ in it.  Shifting the letters in the word âDearâ n times produces no other word in the English language, so it is a sufficient key to know that the decoding has been successful.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The file Prob12.in.txt will contain some number of lines of encoded text.  The file in its entirety should be decoded all at once â each line is not separately encoded.  Rather, the lines together form one long string for encoding and decoding purposes.<br>

       Choices are everywhere.  Left or right?  Beef or chicken?  To be or not to be?  These are the questions.  But your task involves a different kind of choice â one that will take you from point A to point B.<br>
       <br>
       Choosing a path from point A to point B involves evaluating your choices at each step along the way.  During the first half of your journey, the possibilities are many.  Specifically, at each point along the way you will have to choose to move in one of three directions.<br>
       <br>
       However, sometimes in life the closer we get to our destination, the fewer choices we have in terms of how to get there.  Therefore, for the second half of the journey, your choices will start to narrow.  The set of all possible paths will look like a diamond.<br>
       <br><br>
       <img src="pics/082_A.png">
       <br><br>
       Starting at node A, you can choose to go to node 1, 2, or 3.  Your choice there determines your next set of choices and so on.  Once you hit the middle, your choices narrow if you are on the edge.  Being in node 6 means you still have three choices to get to the next level, but being in nodes 5 or 7 reduce your options to 2.  Nodes 4 and 8 have zero choice.<br>
       <br>
       Each path will be given a weight representing the difficulty of going down that path.  Your job is to determine the path (or paths) of least resistance in getting from point A to point B.<br>

       If you were here last year then you may remember Mabel, our resident bingo lover.  Since you coded a solution to check her bingo cards, she has grown bored of the traditional bingo game.  In order to challenge herself again, she started a 3D Bingo parlor to kick it up a notch.  Your task is to help her check for bingos.  The following information will help you.<br>
       <br>
       </p><h1 id="spec">Traditional bingo:</h1><p id="ptext"><br>
       <br>
       A bingo card utilizes the numbers 1 through 75.  The five columns of the card are labeled 'B', 'I', 'N', 'G', and 'O' from left to right.  The center space is usually marked "Free" or "Free Space", and is considered automatically filled.  The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the 'B' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the 'I' column containing only 16 through 30, 'N' containing 31 through 45, 'G' containing 46 through 60, and 'O' containing 61 through 75.  The object of the game is to fill 5 consecutive spaces (a whole row, a whole column, or one of the two diagonals) â which is called a bingo.  The game ends when a bingo is found on one or more cards.<br>
       <br>
       </p><h1 id="spec">3D bingo:</h1><p id="ptext"><br>
       <br>
       3D bingo is very similar to traditional bingo, except that sets of 5 cards can be used to form a âbingo cubeâ, allowing for a bingo in more ways (straight up and diagonally up).  Obviously the free space would cause an automatic bingo, so it has been eliminated in the 3D version.<br>
       <br>
       Mabel really wanted a challenge keeping up with her cards, so she decided that cards could be used in any combination to form a cube.  This means that if you buy 4 cards, you have to rely on a single card for a bingo.  However, if you buy 5 cards, then you can make a bingo cube.  Since the order of the cards does not need to be set before the game starts, there are 120 ways to make the bingo cube out of 5 cards.  Buying a sixth card means that you can make 720 different bingo cubes out of your cards.  You can see how this game would be much more challenging to keep track of.<br>
       <br>
       Your task is to write a program that will tell Mabel how many possible bingo combinations there are during a 3D bingo game.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The file Prob14.in.txt will contain two sections:<br>
       1.	The first section will contain the bingo card information.  There will be 5 input lines per card.  Each line will contain the numbers for one row of a bingo card separated by spaces.  The first 5 rows will make up card number 1, the second 5 rows will make up card number 2, and so on.  The number of rows will be a multiple of 5 (meaning there are no extra rows to throw away).<br>
       2.	The second section will be the numbers called during the game.  The word PLAY will appear on a line by itself to separate the card information from the game simulation.  Following the word PLAY each line will contain a value to be played on your bingo cards (i.e. B3, I27, or B5).  Once a bingo is found, the game stops.  Any extra input after a bingo is found should be ignored.<br>

       Treasure hunting is a lost art form because of all this newfangled technology that everyone uses today.  Did Captain Hook use Google Maps to find his way around the Neverland seas?  No.  He read a map.  And so will you in this problem.  Happy hunting!  Oh, and bring a torch because itâs dark in there.<br>

       <br>
       The file Prob16.in.txt will contain a single treasure map.  Here is the key to reading the map and finding the treasure:<br>
       â¢	H is the starting position of our treasure hunter (thatâs you).  Donât get too lost!<br>
       â¢	T is the treasure that you are trying to find.  You win by stepping on this space.<br>
       â¢	t is the symbol for a torch.  You start out with 15 steps worth of torch light, and every torch you find gives you 15 more.  The torches are unlit when you collect them, so assume you light them just as the previous torch is going out.  So, picking up a torch on your first step would mean that you would have 29 more steps worth of light (15 to start + 15 for picking up a torch -1 for the first step).  Each torch can only be collected and used once.  You must step on a torchâs space to collect it.<br>
       â¢	x is an immovable and impassable barrier, like a cave wall.  You canât step on an x.<br>
       â¢	| and - denote the barrier of the cave.  You cannot step on these spaces either.  Donât worry about how you got in the cave or how youâll get out â finding the treasure will distract you from things like how to survive in a cave that apparently has no exit.  <br>
       â¢	Stepping on a space more than once is permitted (and in some cases required â see the example problems).  However, as previously mentioned stepping on a torch space twice will only give you extra light the first time.<br>
       â¢	You can move up, down, left, and right only.  Moving to a diagonal space takes two moves.<br>

       IP addresses consist of 4 decimal numbers ranging from 0 to 255 separated by periods (this is called dotted decimal notation).

In Java, method and variable names typically start with a lowercase letter, with all subsequent words starting with a capital letter (example: startThread).  Names of classes follow the same pattern, except that they start with a capital letter (example: BlueCar).<br>
       <br>
       Your task is to write a program that creates or splits Camel Case variable, method, and class names.<br>

       Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.  It is used heavily in the IT world to pass data around from system to system.<br>
       <br>
       XML looks very much like HTML in that XML elements are encased in a set of less than and greater than signs.  End tags are similar but have a slash at the beginning of the element name.  Here is an example:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/097_A.png" width = 800px>
       <br>
       XML tags can be named whatever you want, and they can be nested (which is what starts to unleash the true power of XML).  Your job is to look through an XML file and list the element names that you find in order and the number of times that element name exists in the XML file.  Remember - do not count the ending tags, only the starting ones!<br>

       Two friends have been using instant messenger and have also been watching too many spy movies.  They are afraid that people will be able to listen in on their conversation, so they use steganography to hide what they are talking about.  The friends send each other YouTube links that follow this pattern:<br>
       <br>
       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYU8Q3<br>
       <br>
       This looks like any normal YouTube link to the untrained eye, but the text after the âv=â is actually an encoded message.  Your job is to write a program that will decode a conversation encoded using these YouTube links.  The encoding is done using the following table:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/098_A.png">
       <br>
       Every character in normal text is split into two encoded characters as follows:<br>
       1.	Find the ASCII value of the character (for example, the letter h has an ASCII value of 104, or 01101000).<br>
       2.	Use the integer value of the first 4 bits to get the first encoded character (for h, the first 4 bits are 0110, or 6, which maps to U from the table).<br>
       3.	Do the same for the second 4 bits (for h, the second 4 bits are 1000, or 8, which maps to Y from the table).<br>
       4.	Put these encoded characters together and repeat the process for each character in the string you are encoding (so h would map to UY).<br>
       <br>
       Your program should reverse this process to find the actual text from the encoded link parameters.<br>

       Word search puzzles have provided a challenging game for all ages since they were first introduced over 40 years ago.  They require a keen eye and plenty of patience to complete.  Seemingly random letters are aligned in a square or rectangular grid.  Generally, they are kept to 30x30 or less but they can be of any size.  Given a list of words, the solver must find every listed word in the grid.  The words can be found in the following different directions: across, up, down, diagonally, and reversed in any direction.   Your task is to create a program that will find the words in the grid.<br>

       The file Prob14.in.txt will contain a grid of uppercase letters.  The grid can be up to any size and will not necessarily be square.  The line above the grid will have the string â#PUZZLEâ without the quotes.   Following the grid there will be a list of words, each on a separate line.  The line above the beginning word in the list will have the string â#WORDSâ without the quotes.  Remember that the first row and first column of the grid start at 0, not 1.  In the following example, the first letter âJâ is at location [0,0], not [1,1].<br>

       Mabel loves to play bingo.  She needs your help to be able to play multiple cards at the same time.  She will provide you with the numbers for each card and the numbers called for a bingo game.  You will need to tell Mabel which of her bingo cards are winners.  There is no limit to the number of cards Mabel can play and no limit to the number of winning cards.<br>
       <br>
       A Bingo card utilizes the numbers 1 through 75.  The five columns of the card are labeled 'B', 'I', 'N', 'G', and 'O' from left to right.  The center space is usually marked "Free" or "Free Space", and is considered automatically filled.  The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the 'B' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the 'I' column containing only 16 through 30, 'N' containing 31 through 45, 'G' containing 46 through 60, and 'O' containing 61 through 75.  The object of the game is to fill 5 consecutive spaces (a whole row, a whole column, or one of the two diagonals).  The game ends when a bingo is found on one or more cards.<br>

       1.	The first section will contain the bingo card information.  There will be 5 input lines per card.  Each line will contain the numbers for one row of a bingo card separated by spaces.  Since the free space is in the very middle of the card, the third row of input will have only 4 numbers.  The first 5 rows will make up card number 1, the second 5 rows will make up card number 2, and so on.<br>
       2.	The second section will be the numbers called during the game.  The word PLAY will appear on a line by itself to separate the card information from the game simulation.  Following the word PLAY each line will contain a value to be played on your bingo cards (i.e. B3, I27, or B5).  Remember, the FREE space is always considered to be automatically played.<br>

       Fingerprint authentication is one of the most popular and reliable of the many different methods of biometrics.  It is used to tell the authenticator what you are (fingerprint) instead of what you know (password) or what you have (badge).  A fingerprint consists of a pattern of ridges and valleys that are unique across individuals and do not change throughout our lives.  The descriptions of these patterns are known as minutiae and are points on the fingerprint where the ridges split or end.  Authentication relies on reading these minutiae and comparing it to the userâs template in a database.  Minutia extraction can be done through a series of steps that include binarization, thinning, and minutia detection.  Binarization converts the image of the fingerprint into a binary image where a pixel can only be black or white.  Thinning is then used to reduce the width of the ridges to a length of one pixel for easier detection of minutiae.  Finally, minutiae detection is done by reading each group of pixels and looking for any splitting or ending of the ridges.  This problem is concerned with the thinning step of minutia extraction.<br>

       The Zhan-Suen algorithm is a popular method for thinning a binarized image.  It consists of a series of steps that looks at a pixelâs surrounding pixels and marking it for deletion based on the values of these neighboring pixels.  For example, pixel P which is a 1 (black pixel) has 8 surrounding neighbors as seen below.<br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/102_B.png">
       <br>
       â¢	N(P) equals the number of neighbors for P that are set to 1 (P1-P8).  <br>
       Ex: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 = 1.  So N(P) = 5<br>
       â¢	S(P) equals the number of transitions from 0 to 1 (P1->P2, P2->P3, P3->P4,â¦, P8->P1).<br>
       Ex: P8(0)->P1(1).  So S(P) = 1<br>
       <br>
       The algorithm is as follows:<br>
       <br>
       1.	For each pixel P set to 1, mark P for deletion if:<br>
       a.	 2 â¤ N(P) â¤ 6 AND<br>
       b.	S(P) = 1 AND<br>
       c.	P1 * P3 * P5 = 0 AND<br>
       d.	P3 * P5 * P7 = 0<br>
       2.	After all pixels in the input have been checked, delete all pixels marked for deletion by setting them to 0<br>
       3.	For each pixel P set to 1, mark P for deletion if:<br>
       a.	 2 â¤ N(P) â¤ 6 AND<br>
       b.	S(P) = 1 AND<br>
       c.	P1 * P3 * P7 = 0 AND<br>
       d.	P1 * P5 * P7 = 0<br>
       4.	After all pixels in the input have been checked, delete all pixels marked for deletion by setting them to 0<br>
       5.	If any pixels in steps 2 or 4 were deleted, go back to step 1 and read through all pixels again<br>
       <br>
       Hint: Do not delete pixels when iterating through the input pixels in steps 1 and 3.  Only mark them for deletion.<br>
       <br>
       Hint: If any neighboring pixels are out of bounds of the array, then those neighboring pixels are set to 0.<br>
       Ex: In pixel P at input_pixel[0,0], the gray indexes will be 0<br>

       In 1962, John Glenn completed a historic spaceflight, orbiting the Earth three times in a small spacecraft. This flight was one of many that paved the way for an era of space exploration, eventually leading to the moon landings just seven years later. Despite the seemingly simple nature of Glennâs flight, it still required very precise calculations to ensure that he remained in orbit and didnât either fly off into space or come crashing back to Earth. <br>
       Objects in orbit donât remain in space simply
       because theyâve left Earthâs atmosphere; theyâre
       still constantly falling towards Earth. The reason
       they stay in space is because theyâre moving so
       fast that they continually âmissâ the Earth as they
       fall. In the case of John Glennâs historic flight, he
       was moving at an orbital speed of 17,544 miles per
       hour (28,234.8 kilometers per hour). This is fast
       enough to travel from New York to London in less
       than 12 minutes. During his entire flight, which
       lasted just short of five hours, Glenn travelled a total distance of 75,679.3 miles (121,794 kilometers).

       Images can be saved onto a computer in many different types of file formats, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. JPEG (or JPG) images are commonly used for photography, because their format allows the image information to be compressed, reducing the size of the file and allowing you to take more pictures. The downside to this is that repeatedly editing a JPEG image causes the quality of the image to gradually get worse over time; each time the file is saved, the existing image data is compressed further and further, losing fine details.
       The process of compressing a JPEG image is
       complicated but can be broken down into several
       individual steps. One of these steps is called
       quantization, which takes a wide range of numbers created by a previous step in the process and converts them to a smaller, more manageable scale. This results in some loss of detail as previously mentioned; two different but close numbers may be converted to the same result number. However, the human eye often cannot discern very high-frequency changes, so this loss is usually not noticeable. <br>

       Virtual Reality has exploded into the market in the last five years, being used for everything from games and entertainment to product design and engineering. One of the more recent advances in VR headset design is the addition of eye tracking to increase performance. <br>
       The human eye has an extremely narrow field of view in which perfect 20/20 vision is attainable and fine detail can be distinguished. This clarity of vision is due to the fovea, a small depression in the inner retina specialized for this purpose. However, due to the size of the fovea, the human eye can only see clearly within a field of view of less than 10Â°. The rest of our vision comes from the brain piecing together imagery as we look around. <br>
       Due to this fact, a VR headset only needs to render the highest resolution imagery directly where the user is looking. Images outside of that field of view can be rendered at a lower quality, increasing the performance of the system. <br>

       Your program will be given the coordinates within the grid at which the user is currently focusing their sight, and will need to output the rendering level of each cell in the grid row by row. <br>
       The cell the user is looking directly at should be rendered at full quality - 100%. All cells around that cell should be rendered at half quality (50%), and all cells around those should be rendered at one-quarter quality (25%).

       Times and periods of times can be expressed in many different ways. National and regional differences, and even personal preferences, have led to a wide range of formats for expressing times. This can lead to a great deal of confusion; does the date 01/03 refer to January 3rd or March 1st... or January 2003? Is the time 8:45 in the morning or the evening? <br>
       You have been asked to break through some of this confusion by converting a list of times to a new, consistent format. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program will receive a list of time durations that provide the number of hours, minutes, and/or seconds within the duration. <br>

       	â¢	Minutes will be given as a non-negative integer followed by a lowercase letter âmâ (e.g. 2m). Minutes will range from 0 to 59 inclusive. <br>
       <br>
       	â¢	Seconds will be given as a non-negative integer followed by a lowercase letter âsâ (e.g. 2s). Seconds will range from 0 to 59 inclusive. <br>
       These values may not be presented in this order. Values may be separated by spaces, commas, and/or the word âandâ; this text should be ignored. Some of these values may be missing; for example, an input may only give you minutes and seconds. Any omitted values should be assumed to be zero. <br>
       Regardless of what information is provided, your program will need to print the duration in a simpler, more consistent format: <br>
       HH:MM:SS <br>
       In this format, HH is a two-digit number representing the number of hours (including a leading zero, if necessary). MM is a two-digit number representing the number of minutes (including a leading zero, if necessary). SS is a two-digit number representing <br>

       the number of seconds (including a leading zero, if necessary). Each number is separated from the next with a colon, and they are always presented in the same order. All numbers must be included with the output, even if they are zero. <br>

       The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known ciphers,
       and among the simplest to learn. It is a âsubstitution
       cipherâ, in which each letter in the original message (the âplaintextâ) is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, an A would be replaced with a B, a B would be replaced with a C, and so on. This method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.
       To pass an encrypted message from one person to another, it is necessary that both parties have the âkeyâ for the cipher, so that the sender can encrypt it and the recipient can decrypt it. For the Caesar Cipher, the key is the number of letters by which to shift the cipher alphabet.

You will be given a list of encrypted messages, and the key believed to be used to encrypt those messages. Your program must decrypt those messages. <br>
       For the purposes of this problem, we will be using the English alphabet, shown below in its standard order (with a shift of 0). <br>
       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ <br>
       If encrypting a message with a shift of 1, each letter in the plaintext will be replaced with the respective letter shown in the 1-shifted alphabet below. <br>
       BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZA <br>
       To decrypt a message, the process is reversed; a letter in the ciphertext would be replaced with the respective letter in the original English alphabet. <br>
       Spaces are not encrypted in this cipher and should remain in place when decrypting a message. <br>

       The âMonty Hall Problemâ is a statistical problem named after the original host of the game show âLetâs Make a Deal!â In one of the gameâs more famous segments, the host would give a contestant the choice of three doors. Behind one door was a car, but goats were behind the other two. The contestant would pick a door - for example, Door Number 1 - and the host, who knew what was behind each door, would pick a different door - for example, Door Number 3 - and open it. The hostâs door would always contain a goat. The host would then give the contestant the option to switch to the other unopened door (Door Number 2, in this case). <br>
       The problem is this: is it to the contestantâs advantage to switch doors? Does it matter if they switch? <br>
       It may seem counter-intuitive, but the answer is yes - the contestant is actually twice as likely to win if they switch! The reason why has stumped even experts in mathematics until they had the solution proved to them. Hereâs the solution: <br>
       When the contestant makes their first choice, each door has a 33% chance of having a car behind it. To put this another way, thereâs a 67% chance the contestant is wrong - that the car is behind one of the other two doors. <br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/114_A.png">
       When the host opens one of the two incorrect doors, these probabilities donât change; the contestantâs door still has a 33% chance of being right, and a 67% chance of being wrong. What has changed is that we know one of the other two doors in in fact wrong; it now has a 0% chance of being correct... shifting the 67% correct chance once shared between the two unselected doors to the single remaining door. <br>
       <img src="pics/114_B.png">
       To summarize, thereâs still a 67% chance that the contestant is wrong, but with only one other option remaining, that means the contestant has a 67% of being right if they switch to that other option. Itâs not a guarantee, but theyâre still twice as likely to win! <br>

      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Youâve been hired by a TV studio that wants to create a new game show based upon the Monty Hall problem. In case contestants are familiar with the problem, however, theyâre changing the game to make things more exciting. <br>
       The game will start with a number of doors (greater than 3). As before, only one door actually contains a prize. The contestant will pick one of these doors at the start of the game. The host will then open one or more of the doors the contestant did not select that do not contain prizes. The contestant will then be given the opportunity to select a new door if they wish. This process continues until the last round, where the contestant is given one final chance to switch doors. The door with the prize is then revealed. <br>
       The TV studio wants to conduct simulations of what they believe will be a worst-case scenario; a particularly knowledgeable contestant, and a particularly helpful host. Specifically, they want to run simulations in which the contestant and host follow these rules: <br>
       Problem 12: Monty Hall <br>
       <br>
       	â¢	When given the option to select a door, the contestant will select the door with the highest probability of winning. In the event of a tie, the contestant will select the door with the lowest number amongst those that are tied. <br>
       <br>
       	â¢	When opening doors, the host will open the doors that had the highest probability of winning after the previous round. The host will never open the door with the prize and will never open any door the contestant has ever selected (either currently or previously). <br>
       For example, consider a game in which there are ten doors. The prize is behind door number 6 (marked in green), and three doors will be opened in each of two rounds. The contestant starts by selecting the lowest numbered door, 1 (marked in yellow) <br>
       <img src="pics/114_C.png">
       The host now opens three doors. Since all doors have an equal chance of having the prize, he opens the last three doors: 8, 9, and 10. This increases the probability of all the doors the contestant did not select: <br>
       <img src="pics/114_D.png">
       The contestant is then given a chance to switch doors. The unselected, unopened doors now each have a 15% chance of being correct, so the contestant selects the first one of them. The host then opens three more doors with a high probability of winning. Normally he would open doors 5, 6, and 7, but door 6 contains the prize. As a result, he skips over door 6 and opens doors 4, 5, and 7 instead: <br>
       Only four doors remain now, and the contestant is again given the chance to switch. With two doors now at a 37.5% probability of being correct, he selects the first one of those. Unfortunately, his choice is incorrect, but heâs still more than tripled his chances of winning from when the game started, simply by switching doors. <br>
       <img src="pics/114_E.png">
       Your task is to write a program that will simulate several variations of this game. In each simulation, the contestant and host will both follow the rules outlined above. You must determine what the contestantâs chances of winning was are the end of each game. <br>

       Bitcoin and other âcryptocurrenciesâ are fast becoming very popular in todayâs world. They are vastly different from traditional ways of paying for things, in that they donâtâ require a bank or credit card company to act as a mediator between the buyer and seller. This avoids having to give the bank or other organization a transaction fee. <br>
       Instead, bitcoin is given directly to the other party. However, this leaves a big problem - how do you prove youâve paid for something? Or that you even have the money to pay in the first place without someone vouching for you? This is known as the âdouble spending problem.â <br>
       Instead of a bank recording all transactions in a central ledger, all users of bitcoin record all of the transactions at the same time. This means that any attempt to fool the system would be noticed and the transaction rejected. This is done through something called âblockchain.â In this problem, we will build a simple blockchain for LMCoin, our very own digital currency. <br>
       As the name implies, a blockchain consists of several âblocksâ of data, each representing a separate transaction. Each block is identified by a unique âhashâ, a value that is generated using all of the information stored in a block; this includes the hash of the previous block in the chain. Therefore, as we go along the chain, the integrity of the chain increases and ensures past transactions cannot be altered. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created by âminingâ them; adding a new block to the chain that produces a unique âhashâ value within a certain range - this involves a lot of guesswork! <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       You will need to write a program that implements the LMCoin blockchain. As the name implies, a blockchain consists of several âblocksâ of data, each representing a separate transaction. Besides the start block (which doesnât include the last item), each block has four pieces of information: <br>
       1. A timestamp indicating when the block was created 2. Some data (such as a pizza order, for example)<br>
       3. An index (this blockâs position in the chain)<br>
       4. The hash of the previous block in the chain <br>
       The hash algorithm used by our currency will work as follows: <br>
       <img src="pics/117_A.png">
       Where: <br>
       	â¢	ð is the index of the block within the chain; the first block in the chain has index 1. <br>
       <br>
       	â¢	ð»ð is the hash for the block at index ð. (ð»0 = 0) <br>
       <br>
       	â¢	ð is the timestamp of the block at index ð. ð <br>
       <br>
       	â¢	ð is the numeric value of the data in the block at index ð (explained below). ð <br>
       A blockâs data is converted to a numeric value by adding the values of each letter in the data string, as shown below: <br>
       <img src="pics/117_B.png">
       <br>For example, the value of the string âcheeseâ is 3 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 19 + 5 = 45. <br>

       In cryptography, there is an encryption scheme which is assumed to be perfect (unbreakable) under some key assumptions, called the one-time pad (OTP) cipher. The premise behind this cipher is that each encryption key is at least as long as the message itself, and once used, is never used again. <br>
       Two weaknesses in the OTP scheme are the probability of a codebreaker knowing the type of information being encrypted (the âlexiconâ) and the size of the key space. However, even if a codebreaker knows the lexicon, a brute force attack - testing every possible key - is essentially impossible. <br>
       Letâs assume youâre trying to encrypt a message that has a key that is 2512 bits long. 2512 is a BIG number: <br>
       13,407,807,929,942,597,099,574,024,998,205,846,127,479,365,820,592,393,377,723, 561,443,721,764,030,073,546,976,801,874,298,166,903,427,690,031,858,186,486,050, 853,753,882,811,946,569,946,433,649,006,084,096 <br>
       If a codebreaker tried a brute-force attack against this message, and was able to test one key every nanosecond (0.000000001 seconds), it would take 100 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years (thatâs 9 âtrillionsâ) to test every key. Thatâs several orders of magnitude greater than the age of the universe, and while it would eventually give you the correct plaintext, it would also give you every other potentially correct plaintext, making it impossible to determine which message was actually correct. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program will provide an implementation of the one-time pad cipher. Your program will be given a 128-character hexadecimal string representing the encrypted ciphertext. You will then be given another 128-character hexadecimal string representing the key. The plaintext consists of 64 ASCII characters. To convert the ciphertext to the plaintext, use this process, illustrated in the table below. <br>
       <br>
       1. Get the next two hexadecimal characters from the ciphertext (e.g. â4Fâ)<br>2. Convert this hexadecimal value to its 8-bit binary equivalent (4F = 01001111)<br>3. Get the next two hexadecimal characters from the key string (e.g. â0Câ) <br>

       	4.	Convert this hexadecimal value to its 8-bit binary equivalent (0C = 00001100) <br>
       <br>
       	5.	XOR (exclusive-or) these two values together to create a new binary number <br>
       <br>
       	6.	Convert the new binary number to an ASCII decimal value and print that <br>
       character <br>
       <br>
       	7.	Repeat with the rest of the message <br>
       <br>
       Hexadecimal 4F = Decimal 79 = Binary 01001111<br>Hexadecimal 0C = Decimal 12 = Binary 00001100 <br>
       Binary 01000011 = Decimal 67 = ASCII âCâ <br>
       <img src="pics/118_A.png"><br>
       If you are not familiar with XOR, it is a logical operation that checks to see if two boolean values are different. If they are, the result is true (1). If they are the same, the result is false (0). <br>
       Most programming languages allow you to XOR two numbers together<br>
       to produce a new number; these âbitwiseâ operations perform an XOR<br>
       comparison on each bit of the binary representation of those numbers,<br>
       just as we did above in the example: 79 XOR 12 = 67. This can be done with the caret (^) operator in Java, C, C++, and Python, and the Xor operator in VB.NET. <br>

       In 1940, computer scientist John von Neumann defined life as a creation which can reproduce itself and simulate a Turing machine: briefly, a device which acts according to a set of rules. This definition gave rise to a continuing series of mathematical experiments. Among the most famous of these is a âgameâ created by mathematician John Conway in 1970 called Life. Conwayâs Life consists of a set of four rules to be followed by a computer given an initial state of a grid filled with âliveâ and âdeadâ cells. <br>
       In each generation: <br>
       	1.	Any live cell adjacent to one or zero live cells dies (from loneliness). <br>
       <br>
       	2.	Any live cell adjacent to two or three live cells lives. <br>
       <br>
       	3.	Any live cell adjacent to four or more live cells dies (from overcrowding). <br>
       <br>
       	4.	Any dead cell adjacent to exactly three live cells becomes alive (through <br>
       reproduction). <br>
       <br>
       Diagonal cells are considered to be adjacent. Life evolves by applying these rules to the âworldâ represented by the grid. The rules are applied, the world is redrawn, the rules are applied again, and the world is redrawn again, repeating indefinitely. <br>
       <img src="pics/119_A.png">

       These seemingly simple rules are completely deterministic; that is, each generation is determined entirely by the state of the previous generation. Despite this, these rules can yield some very complex behavior. Theoretically, Life is a âuniversal Turing machine;â this means that anything that can be calculated through an algorithm can be calculated with Life. <br>

       How is the internet like the post office? They both use addresses! <br>
       Computers and other devices that connect to the internet are assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) address when they connect. While a newer format is available, most systems still use the IPv4 format for these addresses. In this format, an IP address consists of four numbers, separated by periods. Each number can range from 0 to 255. For example, the address 127.0.0.1 always represents your own computer (the âlocalhostâ). <br>
       As with any other piece of data, your computer stores these addresses in a binary format. Each number in the address is represented by an eight-bit binary string of 0âs and 1âs; these strings are concatenated with each other to form the full address. For example, the IP address 166.23.250.209 is converted as: <br>
       Just like mailing addresses can be grouped by a ZIP code or postal code, IP addresses can be grouped by blocks. Internet companies can reserve these blocks to use in assigning IP addresses to their customers, through a system called Classless Inter- Domain Routing (CIDR). A CIDR block is defined by writing an IP address followed by a slash and the number of bits that match between all members of the block (on the left side of each address). For example, the IP addresses 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.108.68 are represented as the following binary numbers: <br>
       <img src="pics/121_A.png">
       The first 17 bits of both addresses are the same, so these addresses are part of the 192.168.0.0/17 block (any further matches after the first mismatch arenât counted). This could also be written as the 192.168.108.65/17 block, but the convention is to use the first (smallest) address in a block when writing it out in this manner. <br>
       <img src="pics/121_B.png">
                                                                                                                                                                                            <br>
       Blocks can be any size from /0 to /32. A /32 block would require that all 32 bits match; this represents a single address. A /0 block wouldnât require that any bits match; this represents the entire internet! <br>
       For this problem, you are working with the FBIâs cyber crimes division to track down a ring of internet scammers using ransomware to attack innocent people. Youâve been able to track down a list of IP addresses used by the scammers. The FBI wants to get a search warrant to figure out who is behind these IP addresses, but a judge wonât issue the warrant unless you can identify the smallest possible range that covers all of those addresses. <br>

       Machine learning (ML) is a fancy type of artificial intelligence algorithm that uses patterns of previously-seen data to make predictions about new data thatâs never been seen before. ML algorithms can be very complex and can be used to solve extremely difficult problems; for example, neural networks simulate how individual cells in a real, living brain function. However, some are simple, straight-forward, and are great at solving pattern-related problems. In this problem, youâll need to create a machine learning system of your own! <br>
       You are working with the local park service to sort through pictures theyâve taken of birds recently. They want to be able to use these pictures to track the populations of certain species, but they have a very large number of photos and need to find a way to organize them. They decide to follow the practice of animal taxonomy and organize them by the family of the bird pictured in the photo. With the number of photos to sort through, they need an automated means of organizing the photos this way. <br>
       Your colleague suggests that you use measurements of the birds obtained from the photographs to predict a birdâs taxonomic family. She retrieves a set of information about a long list of bird species and shows you there is an apparent correlation between certain measurements and a birdâs family: <br>
       <br>
       <img src="pics/122_A.png">
       <br>
       This graph is called a t-SNE embedding, a type of graph that converts multiple measurements (in this case four) into a two-dimensional coordinate. Each point is color- coded based on the birdâs taxonomic family. As your colleague points out, most of the colors are grouped together, giving her hypothesis that a pattern can be identified more weight. Her suggestion is to determine how âfar awayâ an unknown bird is from these known measurements, and use that to make a reasonable prediction of the unknown birdâs family. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your colleagueâs idea is called a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm. This will predict an unknown birdâs family based upon available taxonomic data and the measurements of the unknown bird. A kNN algorithm works by calculating the âdistanceâ between an unknown datum point and each known data point. The k known data points closest to the unknown datum are then used to âvoteâ for the final decision. <br>
       In this problem, your algorithm should calculate the distance between the given unknown data point and all known data points. Once all distances have been calculated, count how many times each family of birds appears within the K closest points. This is the âvotingâ process mentioned before. Whichever family gets the most votes is selected as the family for the unknown bird. <br>
       In general, the value of K for this algorithm must be an integer; when there are only two possible answers, this is usually an odd integer, to avoid the likelihood of ties during the voting process. Here we have three possible answers, so ties will be possible. To address this, start with an initial value of K = 5 for all unknown birds. In the event there is a tie, increment K by 1 until the tie is broken; reset K to 5 for the next unknown bird. <br>
       The formula for calculating distance between N-dimensional points is as follows: <br>

       Youâre working with an intelligence agency to guide a spy through a secret enemy installation. The enemy has cameras positioned throughout the building with a 360Â° field of view; if your spy is caught on camera, the mission will fail! Fortunately, there are a number of walls blocking the view of the cameras that your spy can hide behind. You need to be able to determine if your spies will be seen based on the position of the cameras, spies, and the walls in the room. <br>

       The amount of disk space on your computer is getting low. We need an algorithm to archive the oldest files (because they probably arenât being used any more) and the biggest files (because they take up the most space). <br>
       Remember that a kilobyte (KB) is 1,000 bytes (B). A megabyte (MB) is 1,000 KB. A gigabyte (GB) is 1,000 MB. <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Problem Description </h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program will be given a list of files on your computer and some information about them. Each file should be assigned a score based on its age and size. Using todayâs date of April 27th, 2019, determine the age of the file in days. A file created in the morning (from 12:00 AM through 11:59 AM) should be counted as 1â2 day older than one created the same day in the afternoon (12:00 PM through 11:59 PM); thus, a file last modified yesterday at 1:00 PM is 0.5 days old; one modified yesterday morning is 1.0 days old. Multiply the fileâs age in days by its size in MB to determine the fileâs score. Remember to account for leap years in your calculations. <br>
       For example, a 1500 KB file was last modified on April 27, 2018, at 10:00 PM. The file is 364.5 days old (365 days, minus 0.5 days for an afternoon time). Multiplying this value by the fileâs size in MB - 1500 KB = 1.5 MB - results in a score of 546.75. <br>

       Sudoku is a popular logic puzzle commonly found in newspapers, magazines, and online. Most likely originating in Indiana in 1979, the puzzle format found great popularity in Japan in the 1980s and became a worldwide phenomenon in the new millennium. Newspapers in particular contributed to the puzzleâs establishment as a household name due to the puzzleâs similarities with crossword puzzles. <br>
       Sudoku is played on a 9-by-9 grid of squares
       divided into 3-by-3 subgrids. Each square is filled
       in with one of the numbers from 1 to 9 inclusive,
       such that in the final solution any given digit
       appears exactly once within its row, column, and
       subgrid. The original puzzle is mostly blank, with only some numbers pre-filled as hints. The player must use these hints to determine how to fill in the remaining squares through process of elimination, logical deduction, and trial and error. In the image above, the bold black numbers are the original hints given by the puzzle; the italic red numbers are those filled in by the player to produce the solution. In order to be a âproperâ Sudoku puzzle, a given set of hints must have one unique solution. <br>
       The properties of Sudoku puzzles have lent it to a great deal of study by mathematicians and computer scientists. Considerable research has been put into finding the minimum number of clues that can be given while still producing a unique solution (17), and into finding puzzles that follow certain patterns. Solving Sudoku puzzles efficiently is a somewhat difficult task in computer science; it falls into the category of problems known as âNP-complete.â This means that it is believed that no algorithm exists that can solve a Sudoku puzzle in less than polynominal time (without having loops nested at least two deep). <br>
